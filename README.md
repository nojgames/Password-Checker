# Password-Checker
A simple Javascript program that checks how secure a password is.

#How to run
Download the project and open index.html.

#Changes
The program isn't that good yet as it only says whether a password
is secure or not based on the length. If you have any changes to
make, fork a pull request. I will merge your change if I think it
is necessary.

#Permissions
You may distribute this program under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license,
which can be found in the LICENSE.TXT file.

#Credits
The original project was created by me. After developing it, I figured that
it needs a lot more work if I want it to become a real password strength
checker. That's why I put it on GitHub.
